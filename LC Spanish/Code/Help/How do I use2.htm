  do I use LinguaMaster?</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If you don't understand a highlighted word 
  or phrase, click on it for a translation. Take notes of new words and phrases 
  that you hear. Print out the dictionary to view and learn off the many phrases and words that arise year in year out. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Use the play bar 
  to replay phrases and expressions, and fine tune your hearing for the Oral and 
  Aural exams.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This structure 
  - listening to the content all the way through and then in stages - is the way 
  the Aural exam will be presented to you in the exam. It is good practice 
  to use LinguaMaster in this way: first get an overall idea of the content, 
  and then pay attention to it in more detail.<p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Use LinguaMaster in conjunction with  your past aural exam papers to prepare you for the Listening Comprehension part of the exam.<p>

LinguaMaster is an invaluable tool, not only for the oral and aural, but for all areas of language learning. If you use LinguaMaster diligently throughout the year you can be guaranteed to achieve your full potential in the Aural exam.
